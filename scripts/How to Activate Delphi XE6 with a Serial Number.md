After downloading and installing Delphi XE6, you will need to enter your serial number to activate it. You can do this in two ways: using the Registration Wizard or using the License Manager.
 
The Registration Wizard is a tool that runs automatically when you launch Delphi XE6 for the first time. It will guide you through the steps of entering your serial number and registering your product online. You will need an internet connection to complete this process.
 
The License Manager is a tool that allows you to manage your licenses and serial numbers for Delphi XE6 and other Embarcadero products. You can access it from the Start menu or from the Help menu in Delphi XE6. To enter your serial number using the License Manager, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the License Manager and click on the "Add Serial Number" button.
2. Type or paste your serial number in the text box and click on "Next".
3. Select the product that matches your serial number (Delphi XE6) and click on "Next".
4. Choose whether you want to register online or offline and click on "Next".
5. If you choose to register online, you will need to enter your email address and password for your Embarcadero account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free. You will also need to enter some information about yourself and your company. After completing the registration, you will see a confirmation message.
6. If you choose to register offline, you will need to generate an activation file and send it to Embarcadero by email or fax. You will also need to receive an activation response file from Embarcadero and load it into the License Manager. After completing the activation, you will see a confirmation message.

After entering your serial number and registering your product, you can start using Delphi XE6 without any limitations.
